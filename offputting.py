# The off-platform projects, after the linar regression one early on 
# in Codecademy just totally killed my motivation for doing anything more
# on Codecademy. 

# Now it's another one up, and I have been off 3 days in a row. And just
# can't seem to be motivated to start it. 
# 
# Those projects is a bit mis step for Codecademy imo. Jupyter notebook
# is not cool. It fucking sucks.
