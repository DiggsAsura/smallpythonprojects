# Okay been doing this for a month. Feel some progression, and also started thinking about
# my first real project. A web scraping thing.
# It's gonna be a long while I suspect, but at least some ideas.
# Today it did feel too rough to start codecademy though, next up is offplatform project
# which last time was a roayl pain in the ass. 
# 
# I haaaaate jypter notebook so hard too.
#
# Will come back stronger though!
